# Decompilation Learnings

Project-specific lessons that apply when matching new functions or adding new
source files. Keep this file focused on reusable compiler behavior, matching
patterns, and verified layout/linking rules.

## IDO Codegen Patterns

- Branch direction matters. For `if (cond) { A } else { B }`, IDO usually emits
  a branch to `B` when `cond` is false and lays out `A` as fall-through. Rewrite
  equivalent conditions to match the target branch opcode and fall-through path.
- `-O2` keeps variables in callee-saved registers more aggressively and fills
  branch delay slots better than `-O1`. `-O1` more often spills values that live
  across calls.
- If a near-perfect match differs mainly by saved-register choices versus
  temp-register-plus-spill choices, try the optimization level used by the
  surrounding object before forcing source changes.
- When assigning a global pointer and then using it, IDO may reload through the
  global pointer rather than reuse the literal object address. Write C through
  the same global pointer path if the target does so.
- Explicit casts can affect sign-extension and register allocation. If the
  target sign-extends an argument with `sll`/`sra`, try making the promotion
  explicit in C, even when the callee parameter type is narrower.
- Before tuning register allocation, verify function signatures and call
  argument order against the target assembly. Wrong argument order produces
  misleading register-allocation diffs and wastes permutation time.

## Structs, Types, and Data Access

- Prefer typed struct and array access over manual pointer arithmetic. Matching
  code should express known fields with `->`, `.`, and indexed access.
- Struct sizes and field offsets must be verified from assembly access patterns.
  A small layout mistake can shift codegen across every function that shares the
  type.
- Use the most specific parameter and local types the surrounding code supports.
  Broad `void *` typing can hide useful offset information and produce unstable
  casts or address arithmetic.
- For known global pointer variables, distinguish between accessing the pointer
  variable and accessing the pointed-to object directly. IDO often generates
  observably different code for those two source shapes.

## Globals, Data, and Linker Behavior

- IDO generates different code for globals defined in the current translation
  unit versus globals declared `extern`.
  - Local definitions can let IDO keep base addresses in registers across
    adjacent stores.
  - `extern` declarations can force extra address reloads and worse delay-slot
    scheduling.
- IDO may place explicitly zero-initialized globals such as `static u8 x = 0`
  in `.data`, not `.bss`. Account for this when splitting raw data/BSS segments.
- Symbols in `symbol_addrs.txt` using `0x700...` addresses are splat
  placeholders. Convert them to runtime `0x800...` VRAM addresses before relying
  on linker resolution.
- Symbol names in `symbol_addrs.txt` drive extraction. Manual edits to extracted
  asm labels are overwritten by `make extract`; rename symbols at the source.
- `#pragma weak alias = real` is the correct way to express weak aliases under
  IDO when multiple names resolve to the same address.
- For data mismatches after source changes, use the data differ to find the
  first mismatching symbol before making layout assumptions.

## Segment Splitting and Alignment

- C object `.text` sections pad to 16-byte alignment. Splitting a segment at an
  exact unaligned function end can shift following raw asm.
- If matched C is smaller than the original asm range, add or adjust asm
  segments so the remaining bytes/functions are still owned.
- When section-end padding causes shifts, it may be better to match the full
  upstream file or a larger aligned range instead of a tiny helper function.
- Split rodata by ROM offset, not by VRAM address. Use the linker map to confirm
  split points.
- Jump-table functions need special care when converting raw asm segments to C.
  Tables in rodata may reference file-local `.L` labels from the original asm;
  splitting functions into separate `GLOBAL_ASM` files can break those label
  references.
- YAML comments are hints, not proof. Verify actual function/file boundaries
  against disassembly, `symbol_addrs.txt`, and the linker map.
